The minimum balance requirement is in place in order to prevent people from overwhelming the network and to aid in prioritization. The first use of a new Stellar address must be to receive at least 1 XLM. This will activate the address and allow it to be used in further transactions on the network. You will never be able to send your entire balance from your Stellar address. That 1 XLM minimum will always have to be kept as a balance."

            "text": "Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash, Stellar transactions involve fees. What’s different is how Stellar fees are determined, and how they are used. For each operation in a Stellar transaction, there is a base fee, which is a standard set by the network. The fee acts as a deterrent, ensuring that malicious actors cannot spam the network in a denial of service (DoS) attack. </Typography>",
            "text2": "The base fee per operation is currently set to .00001 XLM. The more operations your transaction includes, the higher your fee will be. For example, if all you’re doing is sending XLM from one address to another, your fee will be .00001 XLM. However, if your transaction was more complex, like an exchange between currencies, then a higher fee would be required.",
            "text3": "Since Stellar does not rely on mining to add transactions to the global ledger, transaction fees are pooled and then redistributed in the form of inflation. In Stellar’s protocol, new lumens (XLM) are added to the network at a rate of 1% each year via a built-in, fixed inflation mechanism. The inflation funds are sent to an address chosen by the network to receive it each week"

            "text2": "Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash function using three fundamental pieces of information: the address, associated with a balance and used for sending and receiving funds, and the address’ corresponding public and private keys. The generation of a bitcoin address begins with the generation of a private key. From there, its corresponding public key can be derived using a known algorithm. The address, which can then be used in transactions, is a shorter, representative form of the public key.",
            "text3": "The private key is what grants a cryptocurrency user ownership of the funds on a given address. The Blockchain wallet automatically generates and stores private keys for you. When you send from a Blockchain wallet, the software signs the transaction with your private key (without actually disclosing it), which indicates to the entire network that you have the authority to transfer the funds on the address you’re sending from.",
            "text4": "The security of this system comes from the one-way street that is getting from the private key to the public address. It is not possible to derive the public key from the address; likewise, it is impossible to derive the private key from the public key. In the Blockchain.com Wallet, your 12-word Secret Private Key Recovery Phrase is a seed of all the private keys of all the addresses generated within the wallet.
